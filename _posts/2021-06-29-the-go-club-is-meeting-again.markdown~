After some time on Discord, the Go Club is meeting once again at our usual home of The Dice Cup, 68-70 Mansfield Road, Nottingham, NG1 3GY, from 7pm to 10pm. All levels are welcome including complete beginners. Please join our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nottinghamgoclub) for updates and discussion.

As a reminder, our member Robin runs a teaching group on Discord usually on the first Sunday of each month (the July session is on the 11th due to Independence Day). Visit the [Ten Minutes to Go](tenminutestogo.co.uk) website for more information.
